<h3>Unnamed factory game</h3>
<p>A multiplayer survival game where you're defending against waves of enemies by building a factory that powers defensive towers. Probably abandonded. Spent over a year on this, and got decently far, but moved on because it feels so much nicer to work on and finish small projects. </p>
