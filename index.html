          I came back to the factory game once again. I mostly continued from
          where I left off. I created a new Unity project, but reused the core
          package. I mainly worked on setting up peer to peer networking, and
          ended up with a decently compelling system. After 4-5 months though, I
          got tired and wanted to make a small project again.

        <h3>Aces</h3>
        <p>
          An online version of a card game my family plays a lot, called Aces.
          The gist is that you're trying to make sets of 3+ cards, and get all
          cards in your hand into some set. Has an entirely serverless back-end,
          which was a nightmare to get websockets working for.

        <h3>Zombie defense typing game</h3>
        <p>
          A game that has been on my backlog for a long time, and still is,
          where making progress on the phrase causes survivors to fire their
          weapons. Tried using synty assets so I could focus on the game play,
          but ultimately didn't enjoy this strategy as much.

        <h3>Solitary Keep</h3>
        <p>
          After spending a long time on the factory game, I wanted to make a
          small project, using the code I had already written for it. Without
          too much extension I could make a tower defense game, so I started on
          that. Didn't finish though :/

        <h3>Factory game era 2</h3>
        <p>
          After a while on the zombie defense typing game, I continued with the
          facotry game with a rebuild. The goal was to spend less of the
          development cycle in unity, and more in the editor. To do that, most
          of the game logic would live in a package with unit tests, that gets
          imported into the Unity project. This was actually a great idea,
          though I abandoned the project eventually.

        <p>
          Pivoted my mobile hex grid tower defense game into a factory game, for
          some reason. Had a cool landscape, but the dev cycle was a nightmare.
          Having complex logic live in Unity was so slow to debug with the only
          way to test being through playing the game.

          A game where you conquest across a landscape, as a tower defense game.
          The building you're defending is a trebuchet that's seiging the enemy
          fortefications. Had a lot of fun building the map. Struggled quite a
          bit making the game fun though.
