    <h3>Factory game era 3</h3>
    <p>
     A multiplayer survival game where you're defending
     against waves of enemies by building a factory that
     powers defensive towers. Probably abandonded. Spent
     over a year on this, on and off, and got decently far,
     but moved on because it feels so much nicer to work on
     and finish small projects.

    <h3>Aces</h3>
    <p>
     An online version of a card game my family plays a lot,
     called Aces. The gist is that you're trying to make
     sets of 3+ cards, and get all cards in your hand into
     some set. Has an entirely serverless back-end, which
     was a nightmare to get websockets working for.

    <h3>Solitary Keep</h3>
    <p>
     A pivot of my factory game into just a tower defense.
     The idea was to make a simple game to proof the
     architecture, and then later build the whole factory
     game on top of it.

    <h3>Factory game era 2</h3>
    <p>
     After a short break from working on the factory game, I
     restarted it with a rebuild. The goal was to spend less
     of the development cycle in unity, and more in vscode.
     To do that, most of the game logic would live in a
     package with unit tests, that gets imported into the
     Unity project. This was actually a great idea, though I
     abandoned the project eventually.
